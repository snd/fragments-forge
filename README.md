> scrap your boilerplate by auto-generating dependencies!

## env

> quickly read and parse environment variables!

[pattern:](#simple-regex-like-pattern-language-used-in-this-document)

```
"env" ("Maybe")? ("String" | "Bool" | "Int" | "Float" | "Json") EnvVar
```

`EnvVar` is converted from camelcase (example: `BaseUrl`) to uppercase-underscored (example: `BASE_URL`)
and looked up as property on the `env` dependency.

- `envIntPort` parses int from envvar `PORT`. throws if not present or not parseable.
- `envBoolEnableEtags` parses bool from envvar `ENABLE_ETAGS`. throws if not present or not parseable.
- `envStringDatabaseUrl` reads string from envvar `DATABASE_URL`. throws if not present or blank.
- `envFloatCommisionPercentage` parses float from envvar `COMMISSION_PERCENTAGE`. throws if not present or not parseable.
- `envMaybeStringMandrillApikey` reads string from envvar `MANDRILL_APIKEY`. returns null if not present or blank.
- `envMaybeIntPoolSize` parses int from envvar `POOL_SIZE`. returns null if not present. throws if present and not parseable.
- `envMaybeJsonPaymentConfig` parses json from envvar `PAYMENT_CONFIG`. returns null if not present. throws if present and not parseable.
- ...

*serverside only*

## table

> now you don't even need to define your mesa tables...

[pattern:](#simple-regex-like-pattern-language-used-in-this-document)

```
"table" Table
```

auto generate table:

- `userTable` will return `mesa.table('user')`
- `orderReportTable` will return `mesa.table('order_report')`
- ...

*serverside only*

## table object

> mesa tables often need circular dependencies for associations.
> hinoki doesn't support circular dependencies.
> table object resolvers fix that.

[pattern:](#simple-regex-like-pattern-language-used-in-this-document)

```
"table" Table
```

`Table` will be converted to start with a lowercase letter and
looked up as property on the `table` dependency.

- `userTable` will return `table.user`
- `orderReportTable` will return `table.orderReport`
- ...

*serverside only*

## select

[pattern:](#simple-regex-like-pattern-language-used-in-this-document)

```
("first" | "select") Table ("Where" Column)* ("OrderBy" Column ("Asc" | "Desc")?)*
```

this code

```javascript
selectPublicContentWhereIsActiveWhereViewCountOrderByViewCountOrderByIdDesc(
  true,
  {$lt: 100}
).then(function(rows) {
  // ...
});
```

would execute a query similar to
```sql
SELECT *
FROM public_content
WHERE is_active = true
AND view_count < 100
ORDER BY view_count ASC, id DESC;
```

if it starts with `first` it will limit the query by 1 and resolve to the first row or undefined if no rows were returned.

*serverside only - for now*

## insert

[pattern:](#simple-regex-like-pattern-language-used-in-this-document)

```
"insert" Table
```

this code

```javascript
insertUser({
  email: 'test@example.com',
  password: 'secret'
}).then(function(insertedUser) {
  // ...
});
```

would execute a query similar to
```sql
INSERT INTO user (email, password)
VALUES ('test@example.com', 'secret');
```

#### WARNING!

in order to prevent a mass-assignment security vulnerability
the factory returned by `"insert" Table` requires
a dependency named `table "InsertableColumns"`
(example: `userInsertableColumns`) to be present!

*serverside only - for now*

## update

[pattern:](#simple-regex-like-pattern-language-used-in-this-document)

```
"update" Table ("Where" Column)+
```

*note the + at the end: updates without conditions are not allowed for security reasons!*

this code

```javascript
updateUserWhereIdWhereName(
  {email: 'test@example.com'},
  100,
  {$null: false}
).then(function(updatedUser) {
  // ...
});
```

would execute a query similar to
```sql
UPDATE user
SET email = 'test@example.com'
WHERE id = 100
AND name IS NOT NULL;
```

#### WARNING!

in order to prevent a mass-assignment security vulnerability
the factory returned by `"update" Table` requires
a dependency called `table "UpdateableColumns"`
(example: `userUpdateableColumns`) to be present!

*serverside only - for now*

## delete

[pattern:](#simple-regex-like-pattern-language-used-in-this-document)

```
"delete" Table ("Where" Column)+
```

*note the + at the end: deletes without conditions are not allowed for security reasons!*

this code

```javascript
deleteUserWhereName('alice').then(function(deletedUser) {
  // ...
});
```

would execute a query similar to
```sql
DELETE FROM user WHERE name = 'alice';
```

*serverside only - for now*

#### simple regex-like pattern language used in this document

- `"String"` - static string
- `Variable` - user-provided, non-empty, camelcased string that is parsed from the pattern
- `(a | b | c)` - a or b or c
- `(a)*` - zero or many a
- `(a)+` - one or many a
- `(a)?` - optional a (zero or one)
- spaces are used purely for readability

for example the pattern `"env" ("Maybe")? ("String" | "Bool" | "Int" | "Float" | "Json") EnvVar`
means the string `env` followed by the optional string `Maybe` followed by
either `String`, `Bool`, `Int`, `Float`, or `Json` followed by any camelcased
string which will be bound to `EnvVar`.

the string `envMaybeStringDatabaseUrl` would satisfy that pattern with `EnvVar = DatabaseUrl`.

## ideas and raw thoughts

you can not give arguments to the factories
but through resolvers you can give some sort of arguments
through the dependency names

insertMany

data loaders

select should take an optional last options argument
which can contain limit, offset, orderBy, orderDir, orderAsc
as well as a condition which
can be any valid [criterion](https://github.com/snd/criterion) for filtering
and could be parsed from jsurl

$$firstPageWhereIdIsParamsId

$$pageWhereIsActive

$$pageOrderByCreatedAtDesc

$$pageByQuery

? scrap url boilerplate

this is heavy on conventions!!!

? make the conventions changeable

document that custom code with the same name takes precedence

its like rubys method missing.

blaze-forge is a resolver for hinoki containers that can autogenerate
common data accessor functions, loaders, etc.
according to some conventions
and greatly reduce the amount of code needed.

- greatly reduces the amount of code needed

it allows you to ask for things that don't yet exist.

opinionated
convention over configuration.
entirely opt in.
provides defaults which can all be explicitely overwritten.
